# ElevateLabs_task5
🔗 The task demonstrates all major JOIN types (INNER, LEFT, RIGHT, OUTER) using an extended Library Management System.

It demonstrates how to combine related data from multiple tables using SQL JOINs. The LibraryDB2 schema was extended with a new Publishers table linked to the existing Books table.

🎯 Objective: Learn to merge data from related tables
Use INNER, LEFT, RIGHT, and FULL OUTER JOINs
Understand relationships through foreign keys
🛠 Tools Used
MySQL Workbench
🧱 Schema Extension
A new table Publishers was added and linked to Books using a foreign key (publisher_id). Sample publishers were inserted and matched with existing books.

🔍 JOINs Demonstrated
INNER JOIN: Show books with their publishers
LEFT JOIN: Show all books, even without publishers
RIGHT JOIN: Show all publishers, even those without books (MySQL only)
FULL OUTER JOIN: Simulated using UNION (MySQL only)
✅ Outcome: Mastery of mergibg data
Gained hands-on experience using all major SQL JOIN types
Understood how to connect and retrieve data across normalized tables
